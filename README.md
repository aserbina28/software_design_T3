# Software Design

This is the template for the team project of the Software Design course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

## Project Description
Our project is a **file archiver** that allows users to compress and decompress files efficiently. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing file archives, ensuring that users can easily access their data without hassle.

[GitHub release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) is containing the fat Jar of your project in the `out` folder here. The fat Jar is the result of the full build of your project via Gradle.

The fat Jar is runnable using a `java -jar <fat jar>` command.

For more information about the project, please refer to our [project documentation](https://github.com/aserbina28/software_design_T3/blob/main/Assignment%201%20Team%203.pdf).
